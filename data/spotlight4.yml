title: "What is MOOP?"
content: |
  MOOP stands for "Matter Out Of Place" - anything that's not originally of the playa. At the Chapel of MOOP, we believe that even things out of place have sacred purpose and deserve reverence.
  <br />
  <br />Through contemplation and ceremony, we transform MOOP from waste to wonder, from trash to treasure, from matter out of place to matter with grace.
  <br />
  <br />Leave No Trace, but if you find traces, bring them to us for blessing.
